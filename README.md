### Hi there 👋
I started my adventure with programming in January 2022, on a course at Udemy after quit of my job due to improper balance with work/life. In programming, I am fascinated by the possibility of creating, constant development and the end result of my work. I'm an ambitious person with a great willingness to learn and develop. I am looking for my first commercial experience as a frontend developer.
