### Hi there 👋
I started my adventure with programming in January 2022, on a course at Udemy. In programming, I am fascinated by the possibility of creating, constant development and the end result of my work. I'm an ambitious person with a great willingness to learn and develop. I am looking for my first commercial experience as a frontend developer.

🧠 I'm currently learning  React  Native and Typescript
